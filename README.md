# VBA-challenge
In this repository you will find a text file (PatrickDean_VBA_Challenge.vbs.rtf) containing the VBA code I created for the VBA-challenge. This code was developed along side my peers Sarah Schilling, Katie Ballinger, Kyle Tener, Michael Pointek, Jordan, Kiet Hoang, Victoria Martin-Nelson. As well as help from Professor Reed Hyde and the "Credit Card Checker" activity from Module 2.3
